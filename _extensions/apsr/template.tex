% Please note that whilst this template provides a 
% preview of the typeset manuscript for submission, it 
% will not necessarily be the final publication layout.
%
%% Document class options: (**...** are defaults)
%  - bibtex: Uses bibtex+natbib, chicago.bst 
%  - biblatex: Uses biblatex-chicago
%      You MUST select one of the above two options, depending
%      on whether you prefer bibtex or biblatex. This template
%      contains code that uses bibtex.
%  - twocolumn: Switch to two column for main text
%  - singlespace/onehalfspace/**doublespace**: 
%         changes line spacing for main text
%  - **blind**/nonblind: Anonymises authors 
%         and affiliations, or not
%  - autowc: Automatically inserts a word count
%         after the abstract, using texcount. 
%         The abstract is ignored. 
%         NOTE THAT THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU HAVE  
%         INSTALLED TEXCOUNT, AND HAVE ENABLED --shell-escape
%         OR --enable-write18. (These will work on Overleaf.)
%         If you get an error about "texcount not found", delete
%         the autowc option, and manually specify the wordcount 
%         with \totalwordcount{xxx}.
%%% autowc may cause longer compilation time. You can 
%%% disable it first while actively editing, and only
%%% enable it when you're ready to take stock and check
%%% on your work.
\documentclass[bibtex,autowc]{apsr_submission}
% \totalwordcount{500}

%% Example alternative options with everything the opposite of the above: (DO NOT USE AUTOWC WITH BIBLATEX; the word count will be greatly over-reported)
% \documentclass[biblatex,nonblind,singlespace,twocolumn]{apsr_submission}

\title{American Political Science Review \emph{(APSR)} Submission Template}

% The custom \author command takes THREE arguments:
% #1 = Author name
% #2 = Affiliation name
% #3 = Brief author profile, or anything that you'd usually put in a \thanks. Leave blank {} if there's nothing to be said.
\author{Author One}
       {Affiliation A}
       {Author One is PhD Candidate, ABC Department, Affiliation A, 12345 NY. (a.1@example.edu)}
       
\author{Author Two}
       {Affiliation C}
       {Author Two is Assistant Professor, Faculty of Z, Affiliation B, 42813. Corresponding Author (a.2@acme.edu) Additional notes about Author Two.}
       
\author{Author Three}
       {Affiliation B}
       {Author Three is ...}

%% Any other acknowledgements or author notes

%% Useful packages
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{rotating}

%% If you are using a custom figure or table environment from a package and it's not getting framed, add \makeframedenv{MyFigure} in the preamble, where the custom figure environment is \begin{MyFigure}...\end{MyFigure}.
%% Currently table, table*, figure, figure*, longtable, supertabular, sidewaystable and sidewaysfigure will be automatically framed.

%% Handy for setting wide tables/figures in landscape
\usepackage{pdflscape}

%% Recent LaTeX distributions should be able to automatically convert .eps to .pdf; but if this isn't happening, try loading the epstopdf package manually
% \usepackage{epstopdf}

%% Just to add some dummy text
\usepackage{lipsum}

%%% Use \addbibresource{...} if using BibLaTeX
% \addbibresource{sample.bib}
