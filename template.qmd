## Introduction {#sec-intro}

\dropcap{Thanks} for using Quarto to write your article. This Quarto template is unofficial and based on Overleaf's APSR template. Your introduction goes here! Do make sure the first paragraph here is at least three lines long, to accommodate the dropped-cap. Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @knuth1984texbook. As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

```{=tex}
\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}
```
Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use \verb|\ref| and \verb|\label| commands for cross-references.

## Figures and Tables

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table \ref{tab-widgets}, for example. \href{http://tablesgenerator.com}{TablesGenerator.com} is a handy tool for designing tables and generating the LaTeX code, which you can copy and paste into your article here.

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[hbt!]
\caption{An example table}
\label{tab-widgets}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lr}
Item & Quantity \\\midrule
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\floatnote{This is a note for this table.}
\end{table}
```


To include it in your document, use the \verb\|graphicx\| package and the \verb\|\\includegraphics\| command as in the code for Figure \ref{fig:view}.

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{example-image}
\caption{A figure example.}
\label{fig:view}

\floatnote{This is a note for this figure.}
\end{figure}
```
Notes can be added to the bottom of figures and tables using the \verb|\floatnote| command.

```{=tex}
\begin{table*}
\caption{Automobile Land Speed Records (GR 5-10).}
\label{tab-wide}

\begin{tabular}{l l l l r}
Speed (mph) & Driver          & Car                        & Engine    & Date     \\
\midrule
407.447     & Craig Breedlove & Spirit of America          & GE J47    & 8/5/63   \\
413.199     & Tom Green       & Wingfoot Express           & WE J46    & 10/2/64  \\
434.22      & Art Arfons      & Green Monster              & GE J79    & 10/5/64  \\

526.277     & Craig Breedlove & Spirit of America          & GE J79    & 10/15/65 \\
536.712     & Art Arfons      & Green Monster              & GE J79    & 10/27/65 \\
555.127     & Craig Breedlove & Spirit of America, Sonic 1 & GE J79    & 11/2/65  \\
576.553     & Art Arfons      & Green Monster              & GE J79    & 11/7/65  \\
600.601     & Craig Breedlove & Spirit of America, Sonic 1 & GE J79    & 11/15/65 \\
622.407     & Gary Gabelich   & Blue Flame                 & Rocket    & 10/23/70 \\
633.468     & Richard Noble   & Thrust 2                   & RR RG 146 & 10/4/83  \\
763.035     & Andy Green      & Thrust SSC                 & RR Spey   & 10/15/97\\
\end{tabular}

\floatnote{\url{https://www.sedl.org/afterschool/toolkits/science/pdf/ast_sci_data_tables_sample.pdf}}

\end{table*}
```

For wide, double-column figures and tables, use the \verb|figure*| (Figure \ref{fig:wide}) or \verb|table*| (Table \ref{tab-wide}) starred environments. Landscaped figures and tables can be obtained using the \texttt{sidewaysfigure} and \texttt{sidewaysfigure} commands from the \texttt{rotating} package. Alternatively, you can use the \texttt{landscape} environment from the \texttt{pdflscape} package.

Multi-page tables can be created using the \texttt{longtable} and \texttt{supertabular} packages, though note that \texttt{longtable}s cannot be used in two-column documents.\footnote{This is an example footnote. \lipsum[1]}


Currently \texttt{table}, \texttt{table*}, \texttt{figure}, \texttt{figure*}, \texttt{longtable}, \texttt{supertabular}, \texttt{sidewaystable} and \texttt{sidewaysfigure} will be automatically framed.

If you are using a custom figure or table environment from a package (e.g.~a \texttt{MyFigure} environment) and it's not getting framed, add \verb|\makeframedenv{MyFigure}| in the preamble. 

### Lists and Quotations

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

1. Like this,
2. and like this.


\dots or bullet points \dots

- Like this,
- and like this.


An example long quotation:

> This is a sample quotation text. This is a sample quotation text. This is a sample quotation text.

## Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. For a citation in parentheses use [@greenwade93] and for a text citation: @greenwade93. Multiple citations can be given as [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook]. Drop the author like so [-@greenwade93].

If your manuscript is accepted, the APSR production team will re-format the references for publication. \emph{It is not necessary to format the reference list yourself to mirror the final published form.}

## Mathematics

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CLT}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
